| __Published in?__                |  Newsweek (01/31/2020)       |
| __General topic?__               |  Impact of plastic and plastic-derived chemicals on seabirds’ bodies.                        |
| __Procedure/what was examined?__ | __1.__ Scientist fed young seabirds with plastic pellets in Japan. __2.__ Scientist monitor the evolution of the number of plastics in our ocean. __3.__ Scientist survey six seabird’s species living in Hawaii.
 | __Conclusions/discovery?__       |  __1.__ Birds accumulate chemical additives in their liver and fatty tissues 120,000 times more than it should be in normal conditions. __2.__ There is more and more plastic in marine wildlife, every year eight tons go in oceans __-->__ The number of marine animals that ingest plastic will also raise up especially seabirds. __3.__ By ingesting plastic birds are intoxicated by dangerous chemicals. __Moreover__: Plastic can hurt the digestive trac and be mortal for the animal. Plastic also contains hazardous chemicals dangerous and accumulate in the tissues of the animal.|
| __Remaining questions?__         |What the health impacts are on marine animals?|
