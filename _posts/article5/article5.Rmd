| __General topic?__               |  Hermit crabs killed by plastic pollution on beaches.                        |
| __Procedure/what was examined?__ |Scientists monitor hermit crab populations on the Cocos Islands in the Indian Ocean and Henderson Island in the South Pacific, two remote islands.They counted the number of plastic containers and trapped crabs there. 
| __Conclusions/discovery?__       |  __1.__ Plastic containers on beaches = physical barrier and deadly trap for hermit crabs. __2.__ Crabs go in plastic containers but are unable to get out --> living crabs are attracted by free shells of dead crabs and are blocked in turn. __3.__ In one container 526 hermit crabs have been found. __Alarming decrease__ --> crabs are important in ecosystem : aerate soil + disperse seeds
