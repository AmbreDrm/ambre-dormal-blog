| __Researchers__                  |   Scottie Andrew (CNN journalist)  |
| __Published in?__                |  CNN (01/27/2020)       |
| __General topic?__               |  The impact of ocean acidification on Dungeness crabs’ shells.                        |
| __Procedure/what was examined?__ | The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) studies ocean acidification and how changing pH levels are impacting coast and the marine life like crabs.
 | __Conclusions/discovery?__       |  The Pacific Ocean is becoming more acidic because it absorbs more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than before. __Impact on the crabs:__ **1.** Acidity dissolves some part of Dungeness crabs’ shells and damage their mechanoreceptors **-->** without sensory organs it becomes difficult for them to swim and search food. **2.** Carbonate ions used by crabs to build their shells become rarer **-->** their shells become more brittle. **-->** they become less immune to predators. **3.** Larvae with their shell partly dissolved are smaller than the average **-->** problems of maturation **-->** less chance to survive.        **Solution:** Reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere in order to reduce the CO2 absorbed by the ocean.|
| __Remaining questions?__         |The acidity of Ocean has an impact on larvae but we still have to study the impact on the adults.|
