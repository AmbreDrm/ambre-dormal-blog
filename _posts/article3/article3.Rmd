| __Procedure/what was examined?__ |Scientists dissected hundreds of larva fish.|
| __Conclusions/discovery?__       |   Plastic builds up in areas where larva fish grow up __-->__ In nursery waters off Hawaii bits of plastic outnumber baby fish by seven to one. Micro-plastic found in stomachs’ larva fishes, commercially species, coral reef species, flying fish __-->__ dangerous for marine biodiversity. |
| __Remaining questions?__         |What’s the impact on fish health?  What’s the role of slicks for baby fish?|
