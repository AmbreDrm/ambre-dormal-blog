| __General topic?__               | Plastic found in larva fish and in many species of fish                         |
| __Procedure/what was examined?__ |Scientists dissected hundreds of larva fish|
| __Conclusions/discovery?__       |   Plastic builds up in areas where larva fish grow up --> In nursery waters off Hawaii bits of plastic outnumber baby fish by seven to one. Micro-plastic found in stomachs’ larva fishes, commercially species, coral reef species, flying fish --> dangerous for marine biodiversity|
| __Remaining questions?__         |What’s the impact on fish health?  What’s the role of slicks for baby fish?|
