| __Published in?__                |  The Royal Society (11/29/2019)       |
| __General topic?__               |  The effects of vessels noise on the communication and socialization of humpback whales                        |
| __Procedure/what was examined?__ |Comparison of the social interaction of the whales(thanks to   acoustic recordings and  land-based observations) when there are vessels or not|
| __Conclusions/discovery?__       |   In the presence of vessels -> communication and socializing range of whales reduces by a factor of four. __Problem__ : socializing is important for reproduction. __For this moment__ : negligible effect on the population|
| __Remaining questions?__         |/|
